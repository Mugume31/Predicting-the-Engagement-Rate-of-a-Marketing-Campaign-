# Predicting-the-Engagement-Rate-of-a-Marketing-Campaign-
Problem: To Predict the Engagement Rate of a Marketing Campaign 
Context: The marketing team at Motor Vehicle company wants to optimise its cost and follow only individuals that shall engage in the marketing campaign. As a data scientist, I was tasked to help the marketing use analytics to solve this problem. 
In this model, we are working with A Motor Vehicle Company to predict the market engagement rate for the different market strategies.
I used the random classifier model since it's a binary problem where my expected outcomes are either yes or no. I also used the model because of its robustness,ability to provide feature importance and ability to deal with non-parametric data.
